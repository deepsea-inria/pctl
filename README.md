Find full documentation of the pasl parallel container library in the
markdown file `doc/pctl.md`.

The documentation is extensive and most easily read in html or pdf
format. To render in these formats, you will need the
[pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) tool. When you have pandoc installed, you
can render html and pdf versions simply by running `make` from the
`doc` folder.
